# TextRpgGame
This project is about making text based RPG game by java. There are several versions.
'textgame1' package contains first and second versions of RPG text game classes. In the package, 'textgame2.java' code is RPGgame that is made up of only one class.'Textgame3.java' code is upgraded version from the previous one, by using several more classes. The latter one is much more objectly oriented and, has more advanced abilities and functions.

From this project, I could learn
1. fundamental grammar of Java language
2. understanding and practical application of object-oriented programming.
